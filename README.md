# Ecommerce Marketplace

## Intro
I created this multivendor marketplace with the idea of providing business's and individuals a platform to buy and sell building materials.
This project was built using Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

## Next Steps
I plan to add a payment gateway and work to install a more advanced Cart and Checkout system. I will also continue to add user functionality and also a chat system so users can communicate more easily.
